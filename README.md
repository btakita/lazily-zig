# lazily-zig
A Zig library for lazy evaluation with context caching...With FFI to use with other languages.

This project is still in early stages.
Will use similar semantics as [lazily-py](https://github.com/btakita/lazily-py).

The main use case is Zig libraries for cross-platform logic via FFI. Building dynamic libraries for Native Apps/Flutter + servers and WASM for browsers.
